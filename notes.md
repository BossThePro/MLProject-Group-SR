Possible Y variables
- Category
    - Low/med/high risk
    - Type of risk
- Quantitative
    - Claims per year
        - Layer with another regression to categorize whether or not they are risky or not
        - Heavily correlated with bonus/malus, not entirely correlated
            - Should test it though
    - BMS class increase/stay/decrease



BMS Bonus Hunger
- Should I made the claim, or incur the cost to keep my BMS class?


**Correlated Values**
- Area/Density/Region
- NbClaims/Exposure - BMS




Measurement of risk:
Use 1 minus the area under the claim distribution curve as the numerator
And use the exposure as the denominator

High area (no to few claims) & low exposure -> Possibility for future claims -> *medium* risk
High area (no to few claims) & high exposure -> Little chance for future claims, likely to do no claims -> low risk
Low area (many claims) & low exposure -> Already showing signs of claims in little time -> **high** risk
Low area (many claims) & high exposure -> Already showed signs of many claims in long period -> *medium* risk

-Find probability of future claims as target variables?
